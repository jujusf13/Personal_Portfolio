    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <section class="paragraph">
        <p class="education">
            I graduated from Saint Joseph's Preparatory School in Philadelphia in May 2022.
            I'm currently a student at Ursinus college studying to get my B.A. in Computer Science with minors in 
            economics and data analytics.
        </p>   
        <p class="programming-skills">
            Python is my best programming language. I used it most in my most difficult class to date, 
            Data Structures and Algorithms. I was able to learn C++ in my object oriented programming language class
            as well as first learning the linked list and tree data strucures in that class. Java was my second language I learned, taking it as a freshman
            in college. It's been a while, but refreshing on it to learn more advanced concepts would not be an issue. HTML and CSS are languages I wanted to learn
            because of my interest in web development. I'm still a novice and am using this website as a chance to improve my skills.

        <p class="professional-goals">  
            To gain industry experience, an internship for the summer of 2024 is a top priority of mine. I'm mostly interested in
            full-stack, frontend, or backend development but I'm open to all realms of computer science. In such a large field there
            is so much to learn so I want to keep all my options open.
        <p class="personal-skills">    
            As a member of the men's soccer team at school, I have developed skills such as being a coachable indiviudal, being able to work with groups, and
            being a quick decision maker and problem-solver. I'm comfortable making compromises as part of a team even when it is not in my
            best interest. I know when to lead others and when to help others who need some direction. As an athlete, unexpected things will come
            up in games. I've learned to act fast in these situations to mitigate or even solve the problem at hand.
        </p>
        <p class="learning">   
            As the field of computer science is ever-growing, I am comititted to always learning more. I realized the more that
            I know, the more that I know I really don't know anything. That has become a driver for me to possess as much knowledge 
            about the field that I possibly can.

    <h1>To-Do List</h1>

            In taking on this personal project, I've honed my web development skills,
            particularly in JavaScript and DOM manipulation. Using document.querySelector, 
            I navigated and selected HTML elements like buttons and input boxes. 
            The creation of elements through document.createElement showcased my 
            ability to manipulate the Document Object Model.
        </p>   
        <p>
            The implementation of event listeners, such as those on the submitButton
            and ul, was an example of my learning to handle user interactions. I made sure 
            to include a conditional statement, checking for non-empty input before 
            appending a new list item, demonstrating my commitment to data validation. 
            This ensures that only meaningful tasks find their place in the to-do list.
        </p>  
        <p>  
            Moreover, the use of loops, especially in the "Clear All" functionality, where a 
            while loop efficiently removes all child elements within the ul, highlights my practical 
            understanding of looping constructs. This not only clears the entire to-do list but also 
            underscores my ability to handle complex tasks. In essence, this project encapsulates a 
            well-rounded skill set, from debugging and string manipulation to event delegation and CSS 
            class management, contributing to the creation of a robust and functional to-do list application.

    <h1>Lesson On Debugging</h1>
    <section class="paragraph">
        <p>
            Teaching at Cheltenham High School has been an invaluable experience that has allowed me to apply 
            and enhance the skills acquired in my computer science pedagogy class. One fundamental skill I honed 
            through this experience is the concept of backwards design. It involves planning a lesson or project by first 
            identifying the desired learning outcomes and then crafting activities and assessments to meet those objectives.
            This approach has proven effective in creating well-structured and purposeful lessons.

            In addition to curriculum planning, my time at Cheltenham High School has significantly contributed 
            to the development of my public speaking and presentation skills. Conducting lessons and delivering 
            information in a clear and engaging manner was essential to fostering an effective learning environment. 
            This experience has not only bolstered my confidence as an educator but has also honed my skills 
            in articulating concepts to students in a clear manner.

            One notable teaching moment involved instructing students on the crucial skill of debugging 
            during a presentation. The session focused on practical problem-solving strategies, emphasizing the importance
            of identifying and fixing errors in code. Following the presentation, I implemented an interactive approach 
            by having students engage in hands-on debugging activities using code.org code that I had created. 
            This hands-on experience not only reinforced their understanding of debugging techniques but also 
            encouraged collaborative problem-solving within the classroom.

            Below are links to the code I created for the students to practice debugging. To use, you will
            need to create a code.org account which you can easily do by signing in with google. After that,
            click the remix button to allow yourself access to edit the code. The goal is to make each game
            look like a real sport. So if the title says "Hockey", fix the code to make it look and behave
            like a hockey game.
